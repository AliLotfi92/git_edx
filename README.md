# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for AWS, combining document retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Files

### 1. main_rag.ipynb

This is the main notebook that contains all the core components of the RAG system:

- Data Cleaning
- Indexing
- Vector Database Integration
- Retrieval Mechanism
- Embedding Model Implementation
- Text Generation

### 2. embedding_model.ipynb

This notebook focuses specifically on the embedding model used in the RAG system. It likely contains:

- Embedding model architecture
- Finetuning process (if applicable)

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. 

2. Start with `embedding_model.ipynb` to understand and set up the embedding model.

3. Move on to `main_rag.ipynb` to see how all components work together in the RAG system.
